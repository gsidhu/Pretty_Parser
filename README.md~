Pretty Parser
=============

**A personalized RSS feed aggregator.**

# Windows users
Download the `Pretty Parser for Windows` directory. Run `PrettyParser.exe`. Enjoy. (Follow the directions for more fun)

# UNIX
You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system along with the `Beautiful Soup` and `Requests` modules (and probably `LXML` as well if you're not on Linux).

### How it works
1. The `fetch()` function downloads the XML files from the website's server.
2. The `pparser()` function assembles 25 random articles from all the sources and displays them in your system's default browser.
3. The `style.css` file is to make things look Pretty.

Terminal window should say `More articles?` (shows 25 articles by default). Press enter to load a new list of articles. Press 'n' to exit.
Of course you can edit the `feeds` dictionary and the corresponding `feed_tags` list to whichever feeds you want to follow.

*Note to self: Someday I will turn this into a browser add-on. And maybe port to macOS if I feel like it.*

**Special shoutout to the devs behind cx_Freeze for helping port this applet to Windows.**
