				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was much debate over whether Joe Allen should be known as &#8216;The Welsh Xavi&#8217;, &#8216;The Welsh Pirlo&#8217; or even plain old &#8216;Wee Joe&#8217;, but according to his Liverpool team-mate James Milner &#8211; there&#8217;s a few more potential monikers in the reckoning!</p>
<p>Milner was speaking alongside Allen, Danny Ward and Adam Lallana before Thursday&#8217;s England v Wales clash via the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/679399/England-Wales-Liverpool-Joe-Allen-Danny-Ward-Adam-Lallana-James-Milner-Euro-2016-News" target="_blank">Express</a>.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;He went through a stage when he very much looked like [Andrea] Pirlo with his beard and long hair and from there it has developed into Pearlsy. HC &#8211; as in hot cross &#8211; is the other one after he debuted his hair in a bun,&#8221; Milner said. </strong></p>
<p>Pearlsy&#8230;? HC&#8230;?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re truly awful! Especially the latter! Here at EOTK, we&#8217;re quite fond of Allen&#8217;s hair and beard combo &#8211; and find it no surprise that the Welshman&#8217;s upturn in form coincided with the lengthening of his locks!</p>
<p>Milner, known rather unimaginatively as &#8216;Milly&#8217; by team-mates, is unlikely to start the crunch clash versus Wales, following an uninspiring substitute appearance against Russia at the weekend.</p>
<p>Allen on the other hand is one of the first names on Chris Coleman&#8217;s Wales team-sheet, probably only behind Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey &#8211; and has a chance during Euro 2016 to put himself in the shop window &#8211; with Jurgen Klopp yet to decide on his Liverpool future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gareth Bale? Not bad, we suppose &#8211; but he&#8217;s no<a href="http://www.empireofthekop.com/tag/joe-allen/" target="_blank"> Joe Allen</a>!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to Danny Ward anyway, who plays with our diminutive midfielder for both club and country.</p>
<p>Ward, who is a backup goalkeeper for Liverpool and Wales, joked to the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/679399/England-Wales-Liverpool-Joe-Allen-Danny-Ward-Adam-Lallana-James-Milner-Euro-2016-News" target="_blank">Express</a> that it&#8217;s actually Allen and not the world&#8217;s most expensive player who&#8217;s most crucial to Chris Coleman&#8217;s outfit.</p>
<p>He was replying to James Milner and Adam Lallana, who were partaking in a Q&amp;A about the upcoming clash between England and Wales. Potentially, seven Liverpool players could take the field &#8211; five from England, two from Wales &#8211; although Allen and maybe Adam Lallana are the only guaranteed starters.</p>
<p class="storycopy">&#8220;Bale hasn&#8217;t had a full season either. He&#8217;s rested himself at important times,&#8221; Lallana began, before Ward reminded his club team-mate that: &#8220;But our most important player is wee Joseph!&#8221;</p>
<p class="storycopy">Allen comes alive for Wales, because he&#8217;s given an integral centre-midfield role and is allowed to dictate tempo. He excelled against Slovakia in Wales&#8217; opening 2-1 win, and we hope he has a brilliant tournament.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Coleman recently claimed he wish he had two Allens &#8211; one to sit in front of the back four and one to create &#8211; but at Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp isn&#8217;t sure if he wants the 26-year-old at all.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Allen has a year remaining on his contract, and you&#8217;d assume if he isn&#8217;t offered an extension, he&#8217;ll be sold this summer so we can recoup some of the hefty transfer fee once spent on him.</p>
<p class="storycopy">Swansea are keen, and with Piotr Zielinski expected to arrive, it sadly looks like Allen may be set for pastures new come 2016/17.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve been linked with Moussa Sissoko quite a lot, if memory serves correct&#8230;</p>
<p>The Frenchman toiled last season and was relegated with Newcastle under our former manager Rafa Benitez, but was still called up by Didier Deschamps to the national squad &#8211; for whom he appeared in the opening match of Euro 2016 off the bench.</p>
<p>French publication L&#8217;Equipe &amp; German outlet <a href="http://www.sport1.de/transfermarkt/2016/06/hamburger-sv-bietet-angeblich-12-mio-euro-fuer-moussa-sissoko" target="_blank">Sport1</a> claim Bundesliga outfit HSV have tabled a €12m bid, but suggest Liverpool and Chelsea are monitoring the situation closely in regards to a possible summer deal.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/newcastle-united-transfers-moussa-sissoko-11469722" target="_blank">Newcastle Chronicle </a>is not sure this bid is genuine, but do accept Sissoko is a certainty to depart after the Euros.</p>
<p>Sissoko arrived in the Premier League from Toulouse in 2013, and while impressing fans with the occasional dynamic display, has never been able to find consistency. His physicality and potential is huge, but his work-rate and attitude doesn&#8217;t match his ability.</p>
<p>For this reason, we hope our rumoured interest is nonsense. Sissoko isn&#8217;t disciplined enough to play in a midfield two, and not technical enough for the attacking midfield three &#8211; and we think really &#8211; Liverpool can do better.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d prefer Sadio Mane who provides a more obvious goal threat and pace out wide.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liverpool will receive just £250k for Joao Teixeira because the Portuguese is moving abroad and not to an English club, writes Paul Joyce in the <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/679691/Liverpool-receive-just-250-000-compensation-Joao-Teixeira-Porto-Transfer-News-Gossip" target="_blank">Express</a>.</p>
<p>Academy players, which Teixeira counts as because we acquired him before he&#8217;d signed a professional contract at Sporting Lisbon, can be signed on Bosman deals like anyone else &#8211; but provided they&#8217;re 23 or under &#8211; &#8216;parent clubs&#8217; are due compensation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re likely to get decent money for Jerome Sinclair from Watford, and had to spend a significant fee for Danny Ings of Burnley &#8211; but the laws state that £250k is the maximum a club can receive when a player moves abroad.</p>
<p>Teixeira is 23, so this summer is the last window we&#8217;d be entitled to a fee &#8211; although we can imagine the playmaker far increasing his value while back in his homeland.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s technically excellent and oozes talent, but with the likes of Coutinho, Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino vying for spots &#8211; Teixeira would have struggled for game time had he stayed on Merseyside &#8211; although the club DID offer him an extension.</p>
<p>We wish Teixeira well, although hope he doesn&#8217;t excel too much and makes us regret allowing him to leave.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have Liverpool (and Everton) ever been a victim of UEFA skullduggery? We can almost say yes after witnessing the multiple fines handed out to us last season, but it appears the corruption may lie much deeper.</p>
<p>Sepp Blatter, disgraced former FIFA CEO, has remarkably claimed that he&#8217;s aware of high profile UEFA draws which have been fixed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never touched the balls,&#8221; he told Argentine paper La Nacion. &#8220;Of course, you can mark them (by) heating them or cooling them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I witnessed draws at the European level where that happened. But never at FIFA. Of course it can be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put the balls in the refrigerator beforehand. Just by comparing one and the other when you touch them you can tell the cold balls from the hot. When you touch them, you know what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>So&#8230; Blatter is admitting that European draws have been fixed? This is truly shocking, although entirely believable.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/were-everton-liverpool-champions-league-11470258" target="_blank">Echo</a>, who are similarly outraged by the quotes, made this point regarding draws we&#8217;ve experienced:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;In previous years English teams enjoyed draws against clubs like Zilinia of Slovakia (Chelsea 2004), ZTE of Hungary (Manchester United 2003) and Željeznicar of Bosnia (Newcastle in 2002) &#8211; but in 2005 Everton were handed the toughest draw imaginable against Spanish side Villarreal &#8211; who went on to reach that season’s semi-finals.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;Liverpool fans were also bemused to draw national rivals Chelsea in the 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009 Champions League knockout stages, and also in the 2006 group stages, at a time English teams were dominating the competition.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no proof that any English sides have been directly affected by rugged draws, but the fact Blatter is making these claims about UEFA certainly begs the question.</p>
<p>Of course, the man cannot be trusted and we&#8217;d look into every word the lying Swiss says &#8211; but his claims are still worrying.</p>
<p>We hope that a proper investigation is taken into exactly what he&#8217;s referring to, as the footballing world cannot have this hanging over its head.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It would have been easier compiling a list of Liverpool&#8217;s worst Premier League left-backs, actually.</p>
<p>The likes of Andrea Dossena, Aly Cissokho, Alberto Moreno and Steve Staunton, to name but a few, have tried to play left-back for Liverpool &#8211; in a position we&#8217;ve traditionally had trouble properly filling.</p>
<p>Upon John Arne Riise&#8217;s retirement, we&#8217;ve listed the five &#8216;best&#8217;, although that in itself comes with difficulty!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t believe this first guy gets in, but who else is there&#8230;?</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://twitter.com/Jordan_AC90" target="_blank">Follow @Jordan_AC90</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>5) Jose Enrique</strong></p>
<p>Yep &#8211; that&#8217;s how bad Liverpool&#8217;s left-backs have been; Enrique makes the list. The Spaniard signed in 2011 and enjoyed two productive seasons where he got forward and linked up well with the likes of Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez &#8211; famously assisting the Uruguayan for a legendary effort against Newcastle. Since 2013 though he&#8217;s tainted his legacy hugely. Enrique got injured, struggled to regain fitness and spent his time on social media or on holiday &#8211; much to the annoyance of the fanbase. Worst of all, he chose to stay and pick up a hefty weekly wage when he knew he wouldn&#8217;t feature last term. Glad he&#8217;s gone, but actually decent at his best.</p>
<p><strong>4) Jamie Carragher</strong></p>
<p>Carragher was naturally a centre-back, but he didn&#8217;t make his name for Liverpool in the middle &#8211; and was a cornerstone of the side at left-back during our treble winning campaign of 2000/01. With Hyypia and Henchoz in central defence, Carra provided a reliable, sensible option on the left. He rarely bombed forward but was positionally uncompromised in defence. Unnatural left-backs such as Glen Johnson, Jon Flanagan and Nathaniel Clyne more recently have done a decent job in this position, but Carragher was the best stand-in of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>3) Fabio Aurelio</strong></p>
<p>Could be right at the top of this list if injuries hadn&#8217;t affected him so badly. The Brazilian had a beautiful left foot, and scored some memorable free-kicks with it under Rafa Benitez. In six seasons though, he only managed 87 Premier League appearances; which was a huge shame considering his talent and guile on the ball. Had he maintained health, we&#8217;d have had the position shored up for a decade. As it was, he never fulfilled his potential &#8211; but still makes it in at no.3 due to lack of competition.</p>
<p><strong>2) Stig Inge Bjornebye</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Made it into the Premier League Team of the Year in 1996/97 where he played every game and scored four goals, consistently bombing up the left and supplying crosses for the likes of Robbie Fowler and Stan Collymore. The Norwegian had a terrific engine and at his best, was a genuine asset for the all-action, frenetic style of football Roy Evans decided upon. He lost his place when Gerard Houllier, a more conservative manager, took full charge.</p>
<p><strong>1) John Arne Riise</strong></p>
<p>Easily the best left-back we&#8217;ve hard in the past 25 years. Another Norwegian, Riise arrived in 2001 from Monaco and immediately lit us up, scoring eight goals in his first season, following it up with six the next. Overall, Riise plundered 31 goals before leaving for Roma in 2008, and in truth, we haven&#8217;t properly replaced him since. He could defend, create and score &#8211; thanks to his thunderbolt left-foot which gave Liverpool fans some of our most memorable moments of the <em>noughties</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.empireofthekop.com/tag/albert-riera/" target="_blank">Albert Riera</a> was a good winger who played an important part in our 2008/09 title pursuit, but for whatever reason, Liverpool fans often forget about him.</p>
<p>The Spaniard, who now plays in Slovenia for FC Koper, signed in 2008 but left two years later upon the appointment of Roy Hodgson &#8211; who according to the left-footer &#8211; had a problem with foreigners.</p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;I also remember the day when Roy Hodgson came to Liverpool. He said that he wanted his team to be 90% British, so all the foreigners felt like we’d be having problems in Liverpool and I signed for Olympiakos,&#8221; </strong>he told <a href="http://www.anfieldhq.com/exclusive-interview-albert-riera-june-2016/" target="_blank">Anfield HQ.</a></em></p>
<p>During Hodgson&#8217;s summer in charge he offloaded the likes of Riera and Javier Mascherano and signed six players. Three of which were British: Joe Cole, Danny Wilson and Paul Konchesky. The others; Christian Poulsen, Brad Jones and Raul Meireles hardly pulled up any trees, although the latter was decent in parts.</p>
<p>Under Rafa Benitez, we had a team centred around British stars Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher &#8211; but the vast majority of the side was full of talented players from abroad, such as Sami Hyppia, Pepe Reina, Daniel Agger, Xabi Alonso, Mascherano, Dirk Kuyt and Fernando Torres.</p>
<p>Why Hodgson thought he&#8217;d dismantle a talented squad and recruit mid-table British players is anyone&#8217;s guess. Its results are infamous of course, with the current England boss out of a job before Christmas and Liverpool out of the Champions League for five seasons.</p>
<p>Appointing Hodgson really was one of the worst decisions Liverpool have made in the modern era.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guy&#8217;s left-foot was actually quite dangerous!</p>
<p>John Arne Riise announced his retirement yesterday, so we thought it only apt to share this video of all his goals for Liverpool.</p>
<p>With 31 strikes, the Norwegian is one of the highest scoring defenders we&#8217;ve ever had &#8211; and a scorer of some of our most devastating goals to boot.</p>
<p>Not only did he have a rasping left-footed strike, but he had the knack of entering the box late and finishing at the back-post as well.</p>
<p>When you watch this back, you&#8217;ll see how much we miss a left-back of this stature at the club. What would a peak Riise be worth today&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both ourselves and rivals Arsenal are chasing Sporting Lisbon&#8217;s 27-year-old forward Islam Slimani.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to Portuguese outlet <a href="https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/desporto/604689/eles-nao-largam-slimani-arsenal-e-liverpool-veem-propostas-rejeitadas" target="_blank">Noticiaos Minutos</a>, who claim that the English giants have had €25m bids for the Algerian striker rebuffed, with Sporting holding out for €30m &#8211; Slimani&#8217;s release clause.</p>
<p>The forward lit up the Portuguese league last year, scoring 31 goals in all competitions and announcing his name properly to Europe&#8217;s biggest clubs. It was the first time Slimani had reached 20 in a single season, with his previous best being just 15 the campaign previous.</p>
<p>His enormous improvement has not gone unnoticed though, with Premier League champions Leicester and Serie A side Lazio also monitoring the forward&#8217;s situation.</p>
<p>Slimani is tall at 6 ft. 2&#8242;, but is quick and possesses good feet &#8211; much like Divock Origi &#8211; the young Belgian already on our books.</p>
<p>The Algerian, who has 23 goals for his country since 2012, is talented &#8211; but Liverpool don&#8217;t need a new centre-forward and we find this report hard to believe. Until there&#8217;s news from the respected Merseyside journalists, we&#8217;ll have to assume this one isn&#8217;t happening. With Daniel Sturridge, Danny Ings, Origi and Christian Benteke still on the books, our transfer priorities remain elsewhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We say &#8216;surprisingly&#8217;, although in truth &#8211; the only thing surprising is that <a href="http://www.empireofthekop.com/daniel-sturridge/" target="_blank">Daniel Sturridge </a>wasn&#8217;t already in England&#8217;s starting side&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/daniel-sturridge-considered-shock-england-8183710" target="_blank">Mirror reporter Dave Kidd</a> (alongside the idiotic John Moss) has suggested the Liverpool man will be brought straight back into the side for Thursday&#8217;s crunch Group B clash with Wales.</p>
<p>Roy Hodgson went with Harry Kane up top on his own against Russia, and chose not to use Jamie Vardy, Marcus Rashford or Sturridge &#8211; but the Mirror are convinced that our striker will now come into the reckoning having impressed enormously in training.</p>
<p>Because Wales deploy three centre-backs, Hodgson wants pace &#8211; which Sturridge has in abundance &#8211; while Vardy has dropped down the pecking order following his poor display versus Portugal in the final warmup game.</p>
<p>Liverpool fans are naturally worried about Hodgson ever using Sturridge, due to the fact our forward has come back from international duty injured on more than one occasion &#8211; but those problems are mainly from training &#8211; not games.</p>
<p>If England fail to beat Wales, we could realistically not reach the knockout rounds, so it&#8217;s imperative Hodgson picks his best side; and for us &#8211; that includes Sturridge &#8211; whose goal:minute ratio in the Premier League was actually better than Kane and Vardy&#8217;s last term.</p>

<p>Our legendary ex-skipper played alongside the Norwegian defender from when we signed in him 2001 from Monaco until he left for Roma in 2008. Bar the occasionally fit Fabio Aurelio and perhaps one season of Jose Enrique &#8211; we&#8217;ve not properly replaced him.</p>
<p>Gerrard complimented Riise on his Liverpool contribution, and joked that he had the &#8216;second hardest&#8217; shot at the club &#8211; obviously behind himself!</p>
<p>Having watched Riise&#8217;s free-kick against Manchester United a few times since the announcement, we&#8217;re not too sure Gerrard comes out on top!</p>

<p>&#8220;Clearly he&#8217;s never been to Naples before and probably he&#8217;s in love with The Beatles,&#8221; De Laurentis said when asked about Zielinski&#8217;s likely future, reported by <a href="http://talksport.com/football/poland-midfielder-piotr-zielinski-wants-join-liverpool-over-napoli-claims-serie-sides-owner" target="_blank">talkSPORT</a>&#8230;</p>

<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item even">
<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t want to come, then he won&#8217;t come. If I were him, though, I would drop everything and run here.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="revCon">Liverpool have submitted a £9.5m offer for the Udinese owned midfielder who&#8217;s shone at Empoli on loan for the past two seasons.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It&#8217;s looking more and more likely that Zielinski will become Jurgen Klopp&#8217;s fourth proper signing, following the acquisitions of Marko Grujic, Joel Matip and Loris Karius. Zielinski could arrive as a direct replacement for Joe Allen, who&#8217;s not yet extended his contract which has just one year to run.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Zielinski transfer is not especially exciting, but Klopp proved time and time again an ability to uncover hidden gems while at Borussia Dortmund, and we have to trust him to do it again on Merseyside.</div>

<p>&#8220;My family are all Reds and playing for the club you have supported since you were a little boy is huge,&#8221; Brewitt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great thing here is knowing that there’s a pathway to the first team.&#8221; (via <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fc-defender-tom-brewitt-11465388">Echo</a>)</p>
<p>Brewitt has represented England at youth level and was named in a senior matchday squad for the first time last season against Arsenal.</p>

<p>Origi played the final 17 minutes after replacing Everton&#8217;s Romelu Lukaku. Benteke and Mignolet were unused substitutes.</p>

<p>In the other Group E encounter, Republic of Ireland were held to a 1-1 draw by Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#8217;s Sweden. Wes Hoolahan put the Irish ahead just after half-time, before an own goal from Ciaran Clark meant both teams had to settle for a point.</p>
<p>It means Belgium&#8217;s next match &#8211; against Ireland next Saturday in Bordeaux &#8211; is a must-win game. Failure to take all three points would put them in serious jeopardy of being one of the two third-placed teams to be knocked out.</p>
<p>Will they make it through? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know England&#8217;s travelling supporters don&#8217;t have the greatest reputation in the world game &#8211; but in the events in Marseille over the last few days, they genuinely seem to have been the victims rather than the aggressors.</p>
<p>Joe Tyrrell, who is a Liverpool fan from Woolton on Merseyside, has been telling the <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-man-witnessed-russian-thugs-11468596">Echo</a> about what he saw. According to him, it&#8217;s a &#8220;miracle&#8221; that no fans were killed.</p>
<p>He describes how Russian fans descended on a square where England fans were drinking peacefully, saying they brought unopened crates of beer specifically to use as missiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were out to kill people, there were five or six of them with crates or boxes of beer, unopened.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were passing the guys at the front bottles to go and throw and then they were heading back for more,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guy I helped took a full bottle to the face, he was covered in beer as well as blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;After he was out cold I saw 15 Russians kicking and stamping on his head as he was unconscious. They were even taking a run-up.</p>
<p><iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/4221396001/60716998-ff67-4298-8bd7-2162e15a858d_default/index.html" width="640px" height="360px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a miracle no one was killed &#8211; it really is. When we started dragging him away, I thought he was dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just horrendous. They were hell-bent on causing as much serious injury as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>It really sounds absolutely shocking. We can only hope there are no further incidents during the championships.</p>
