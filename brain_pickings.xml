<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Long-Loneliness-Autobiography-Legendary-Catholic/dp/0060617519/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img width="318" height="477" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thelongloneliness_dorothyday-1.jpg?fit=318%2C477&amp;ssl=1" class="cover alignright size-medium" alt="The Final Word Is Love: Dorothy Day on Human Connection, Music, and the Power of Community" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thelongloneliness_dorothyday-1.jpg?resize=240%2C360&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thelongloneliness_dorothyday-1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></a></p><p><em>&#8220;Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks,&#8221;</em> Walt Whitman counseled in his <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/31/walt-whitman-leaves-of-grass-preface/">timeless advice on living a vibrant and rewarding life</a>. Hardly anyone has embodied and enacted this ideal more fiercely than the great journalist, social activist, and <em>Catholic Worker</em> co-founder <strong>Dorothy Day</strong> (November 8, 1897&ndash;November 29, 1980) &#8212; a woman who practiced what she preached and lived her values in every way: Amid a postwar culture that embraced consumerism as an act of patriotism, she advocated for and lived in voluntary poverty; she defied the IRS by refusing to pay federal taxes on war; her protests against racism, war, and injustice landed her in jail on multiple occasions. </p>
<p>Although Day&#8217;s lifetime of activism, altruism, and infinite compassion for the fragility of the human spirit were motivated by her faith and she is now being considered for sainthood, her legacy remains an instrument of secular motivation for the pursuit of social justice and the protection of human dignity. She belonged to that rare breed of people who manage to live righteous lives without slipping into self-righteousness in the face of human imperfection in others, for they are all too intimately familiar with its existence in themselves. A century after Whitman <a href="http://literaryjukebox.brainpickings.org/post/99336928572" target="_blank">embraced his multitudes</a>, Day remarked of the contradictory parts of herself: “It all goes together.” </p>
<p>It is this allness that Day chronicles with tremendous courage and largehearted wisdom in her 1952 autobiography, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Long-Loneliness-Autobiography-Legendary-Catholic/dp/0060617519/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Long Loneliness</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/long-loneliness-the-autobiography-of-dorothy-day/oclc/7554814&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>

<p>In a sentiment that calls to mind artist Agnes Martin&#8217;s assertion that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/31/agnes-martin-john-gruen-interview/">&#8220;we all have the same inner life&#8221;</a> and Cheryl Strayed&#8217;s assurance that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/15/cheryl-strayed-longform-podcast-interview/">&#8220;when you’re speaking in the truest, most intimate voice about your life, you are speaking with the universal voice,&#8221;</a> Day considers the impulse to share one&#8217;s interior world with the exterior world &#8212; an immensely vulnerable-making act and yet, ultimately, an act of love:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Writing a book is hard, because you are “giving yourself away.” But if you love, you want to give yourself. You write as you are impelled to write, about man and his problems&#8230; You write about yourself because in the long run all man’s problems are the same, his human needs of sustenance and love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joining in the choir of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/03/15/writers-on-music/">celebrated writers who have extolled its singular power</a>, Day points to music as a supreme solace for the human heart and its universal longings. Recounting hearing a psalm at the age of ten and being electrified by an indescribable, all-consuming joy &#8212; a joy Aldous Huxley memorably described as <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/05/aldous-huxley-music-at-night/">the &#8220;blessedness&#8221; of the musical experience</a> &#8212; Day reflects on her lifelong relationship with music and art:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever I felt the beauty of the world in song or story, in the material universe around me, or glimpsed it in human love, I wanted to cry out with joy. The Psalms were an outlet for this enthusiasm of joy or grief &#8212; and I suppose my writing was also an outlet. After all, one must communicate ideas. I always felt the common unity of our humanity; the longing of the human heart is for this communion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Day ends her autobiography by returning to this longing for communion as the central driving force of human life &#8212; something we so easily forget when we buy into the divisive narratives of difference that make us fall apart and so easily remember when disaster and tragedy unite us into <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/rebecca-solnit-falling-together/8691" target="_blank">falling together</a>. Day writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The final word is love&#8230; To love we must know each other &#8230; and we know each other in the breaking of bread, and we are not alone any more. Heaven is a banquet and life is a banquet, too, even with a crust, where there is companionship. </p>
<p>We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.</p></blockquote>

We know that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/16/thinking-with-animals-lorainne-daston-gregg-mitman/">animal-based metaphors are central to our meaning-mongering</a> and that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/19/james-geary-i-is-an-other-children-metaphor/">metaphorical thinking is central to the development of children&#8217;s creativity</a>, which means that animals are our constant companions in the sandbox of the imagination from childhood on. </p>

This fortuitous skill would later save his life. The year of his thirtieth birthday, Chargaff was offered a research position at Columbia University in New York, which he was able to take largely because he spoke English. <em>&#8220;I was afraid of going to a country that was younger than most of Vienna&#8217;s toilets,&#8221;</em> he would later recount. But there was something far more sinister to fear &#8212; the confluence of chance and choice that landed Chargaff in America spared him from the grim fate that befell his loved ones in Europe. His mother and sister &#8212; his only remaining family after his father&#8217;s untimely death &#8212; were among the millions of Jews killed by the Nazis. </p>
<p>As he witnessed from afar the inhumanity that made his homeland &#8220;tumble into the deepest abyss ever to engulf a civilized people,&#8221; Chargaff sought solace and meaning outside the human realm and immersed himself in science. He went on to discover base-pairing &#8212; a principle instrumental in identifying the double helix structure of DNA and thus a centerpiece of our understanding of genetics.</p>
<p>But Chargaff was also an extraordinary writer &#8212; not only an eloquent explainer and champion of science, but a lyrical memoirist and an incisive, erudite philosophical thinker. A master of what could best be described as biopoetics, he writes with infectious wonderment and tenderness about nature and human nature, about knowledge and mystery, about the electrifying joy of slicing through the darkness of being with the luminous saber of curiosity. </p>

<p>His 1978 autobiography, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heraclitean-Fire-Sketches-Before-Nature/dp/0874700299/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Heraclitean Fire: Sketches from a Life Before Nature</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/heraclitean-fire-sketches-from-a-life-before-nature/oclc/4180182&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), is one of the finest books I&#8217;ve ever read, on par with Oliver Sacks&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/18/oliver-sacks-on-the-move/"><em>On the Move</em></a>. In reflecting on his own life, Chargaff speaks not only to what it means to be a scientist and how science in its highest form is done, but also to what it means to be human and what it takes to persevere on our most perennial quest &#8212; to understand reality and make sense of our place in it. </p>
<p>The discovery of this uncommonly wonderful book is a supreme testament to my longtime assertion, only half-facetious, that <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580" target="_blank">literature is the original internet</a>: A passing mention in an <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/18/vera-rubin-interview-women-in-science/">interview</a> with trailblazing astronomer Vera Rubin in a forgotten book &#8220;hyperlinked&#8221; me to the <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/04/mark-kac-enigmas-of-chance-geniuses/">autobiography</a> of the great mathematician Mark Kac, in which he extols Chargaff&#8217;s as the gold standard for a scientist&#8217;s autobiography. The praise is more than merited, and anything said about the book here or anywhere is bound to belie its true splendor, which comes alive only with reading. The pages of this small, enormous book radiate layered and beautifully articulated wisdom on the many strands of life &#8212; psychology, philosophy, politics &#8212; absolutely inseparable, yet artificially segregated, from science.</p>
<p>From the fortunate and far-seeing platform of seven decades of life, Chargaff writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I came to biochemistry through chemistry; I came to chemistry &#8230; partly through the youthfully romantic notion that the natural sciences had something to do with nature. What I liked about chemistry was its clarity surrounded by darkness; what attracted me, slowly and hesitatingly, to biology was its darkness surrounded by the brightness of the givenness of nature, the holiness of life. And so I have always oscillated between the brightness of reality and the darkness of the unknowable. When Pascal speaks of God in hiding, <em>Deus absconditius</em>, we hear not only the profound existential thinker, but also the great searcher for the reality of the world. I consider this unquenchable resonance as the greatest gift that can be bestowed on a naturalist.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nearly half a century before physicist Sean Carroll coined his beautiful notion of <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/31/sean-carroll-the-big-picture/">poetic naturalism</a>, Chargaff considers the historical development of our quest to know reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear that to meditate on the whole of nature, or even on the whole of living nature, is not a road that the natural sciences could long have traveled. This is the way of the poet, the philosopher, the seer. A division of labor had to take place. But the overfragmentation of the vision of nature &#8212; or actually its complete disappearance among the majority of scientists &#8212; has created a Humpty-Dumpty world that must become increasingly unmanageable as more and tinier pieces are broken off, &#8220;for closer inspection,&#8221; from the continuum of nature. The consequence of the excessive specialization, which often brings us news that nobody cares to hear, has been that in revisiting a field with which one had been very familiar, say, ten or twenty years earlier, one feels like an intruder in one&#8217;s own bathroom, with twenty-four grim experts sharing the tub.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same era that Buckminster Fuller made his case for <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/03/08/buckminster-fuller-synergetics/">the genius of generalists</a>, Chargaff speaks to the immense yet endangered value of a robust and indiscriminate curiosity in grasping the big picture:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without a firm center we flounder. The wonderful, inconceivably intricate tapestry is being taken apart strand by strand; each thread is being pulled out, torn up, and analyzed; and at the end even the memory of the design is lost and can no longer be recalled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Writing a few years after Hannah Arendt&#8217;s timeless meditation on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/16/hannah-arendt-the-life-of-the-mind/">thinking vs. knowing and the crucial difference between truth and meaning</a>, Chargaff considers the cause and the consequence of this artificial fragmentation of curiosity:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is hoped that our road will lead to understanding; mostly it leads only to explanations. The difference between these two terms is also being forgotten&#8230; These are two very different things, for we understand very little about nature. Even the most exact of our exact sciences float above axiomatic abysses that cannot be explored. It is true, when one&#8217;s reason runs a fever, one believes, as in a dream, that this understanding can be grasped; but when one wakes up and the fever is gone, all one is left with are litanies of shallowness.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a sentiment that calls to mind philosopher Susanne Langer&#8217;s ideas on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/21/susanne-langer-philosophy-in-a-new-key-questions-answers/">how our question shape our answers and direct our orientation of mind</a>, Chargaff adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our time, so-called laws of nature are being fabricated on the assembly line. But how often is the regularity of these &#8220;laws of nature&#8221; only the reflection of the regularity of the method employed in their formation! &#8230; Science is still faced with the age-old predicament, the lack of ultimate verification.</p></blockquote>
<p>He considers how science is done (in the era&#8217;s gendered language on which Ursula K. Le Guin has made <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/">the finest, sharpest comment there is</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>For a scientific concept to be formulated successfully, a concerted interaction of many requisites must occur. First of all, the right [person] must ask himself the right question. This may well be a random event that occurs much more often than we are aware&#8230; Less fortuitously, this [person] must find an audience, i.e., he must be able to publish and to find readers; and this may not have been so easy even in the bucolic days of the last century. But, most importantly, the times must be ripe for both question and answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing Saul Bellow&#8217;s assertion that <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/10/saul-bellow-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech/">&#8220;only art penetrates … the seeming realities of this world&#8221;</a> and reminding us, half a century after <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/18/bertrand-russell-free-thought-propaganda-doubt/">Bertrand Russell did</a>, of the value of critical thinking in accepting interpretations of reality, Chargaff writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If art represents the highest form of reality that man &#8212; or at least modern secular man &#8212; is capable of attaining, the many instances in which great creations were rejected initially, and often with incredible malice, show how reluctant we are to grasp reality. We accept only what has been predigested for us by the so-called tastemakers; but this is then a spurious reality.</p></blockquote>

<p>Considering <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/19/lisa-randall-knocking-on-heavens-door/">the different ways in which art, science, and spirituality explain reality</a>, Chargaff cautions against the blinders with which specialization obscures the full scope of reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our understanding of the world is built up of innumerable layers. Each layer is worth exploring, as long as we do not forget that it is one of many. Knowing all there is to be known about one layer &#8212; a most unlikely event &#8212; would not teach us much about the rest. The integration of the enormous number of bits of information and the resulting vision of nature take place in our minds; but the human mind is easily deceived and confused, and the vision of nature changes every few generations. It is, in fact, the intensity of the vision that counts more heavily than its completeness or its correctness. I doubt that there is such a thing as a correct view of nature, unless the rules of the game are stated clearly. Undoubtedly, there will later be other games and other rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>With a concerned eye toward the discouragement of curiosity-driven research by the institutions of modern science &#8212; a concern that has only swelled in urgency in the decades since &#8212; Chargaff writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I look back on my early way in science, on the problems I studied, on the papers I published &#8212; and even more, perhaps, on those things that never got into print &#8212; I notice a freedom of movement, a lack of guild-imposed narrowness, whose existence in my youth I myself, as I write this, had almost forgotten. The world of science was open before us to a degree that has become inconceivable now, when pages and pages of application papers must justify the plan of investigating, &#8220;in depth,&#8221; the thirty-fifth foot of the centipede; and one is judged by a jury of one&#8217;s peers who are all centipedists or molecular podiatrists. I would say that most of the great scientists of the past could not have arisen, that, in fact, most sciences could not have been founded, if the present utility-drunk and goal-directed attitude had prevailed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Decades before astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser made his elegant case for <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/02/02/the-island-of-knowledge-marcelo-gleiser/">how to accommodate mystery in the conquest of knowledge</a>, Chargaff considers the true measure of science:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would seem to me that man cannot live without mysteries. One could say, the great biologists worked in the very light of darkness. </p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>What is success in science? Illuminated darkness is not light. We find ourselves in the cavern of limitless possibilities. Take a flashlight with you, and you may find you are only in a lumber room. If I know what I shall find, I do not want to find it. Uncertainty is the salt of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chargaff reflects on how the allure of uncertainty animated his own foray into science:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I remember of my beginnings is the truly lyrical shudder with which I contemplated nature. I am not sure that I even knew what I meant by nature. It was the blood and the bones of the universe, its dawn and dusk, flowering and decay, firmament and graveyard. The alterations of the spiritual and the material tides, the oscillations between future and past, the mysterious fates of everlasting stone and short-lived fly: they filled me with admiration and reverence. Nature, it seemed to me, was almost the entire non-I, the entire non-small-boy&#8230; A small boy begins by being unable to explain the explainable, but when he grows old he often looks away from what cannot be explained. I am grateful that fate has preserved me from this form of blindness. Surrounded by a surfeit of solved riddles, I am still struck by how little we understand.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a sentiment of supreme pertinence to our <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/09/wisdom-in-the-age-of-information/">present struggle to wrest wisdom from the age of information</a>, Chargaff echoes Thoreau&#8217;s insistence on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/05/14/thoreau-walking-ignorance-knowledge/">the value of not-knowing</a> and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would not go so far as to claim that knowledge and wisdom are mutually exclusive; but they are far from being communicating vessels, and the level of one has no bearing on that of the other. More people have gained wisdom from unknowledge, which is not the same as ignorance, than from knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to his formative years, he considers once again the different paths to wisdom, those different modes of illuminating reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should I not have thought of becoming a painter or a poet? But I was entirely ungifted for the first and not courageous enough for the second&#8230; I was a monad searching for a destiny that did not exist&#8230; What I had at the time &#8212; and it has never left me &#8212; was a dream of reality that we could only touch tangentially, an awe of the numinous of nature whose power rested in its very unattainability. It was a feeling for the necessity of darkness in the life of man. In the Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo depicts the creation of man, God&#8217;s finger and that of Adam are separated by a short space. That distance I called eternity; and there, I felt, I was sent to travel.</p>
<p>That this may be a voyage without a destination was no concern of mine &#8230; Only the road counted, not the goal&#8230; When I floated into science, a naive young man could still imagine that he was devoting himself to the study of nature&#8230; For me nature has still remained a synonym for the highest form of reality.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/13/wild-ideas-kelsey-kim/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wildideas_kelseykim1.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Illustration by Soyeon Kim from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/13/wild-ideas-kelsey-kim/"><em>Wild Ideas</em></a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Radiating from his recollection is a sublime definition of what makes a scientist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The feeling that there is always more than he can find, that he is only pulling shreds out of an unfathomable continuum, forms part of my definition of scientist.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It is the sense of mystery that, in my opinion, drives the true scientist; the same force, blindly seeing, deafly hearing, unconsciously remembering, that drives the larva into the butterfly. If he has not experienced, at least a few times in his life, this cold shudder down his spine, this confrontation with an immense, invisible face whose breath moves him to tears, he is not a scientist. The blacker the night, the brighter the night.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heraclitean-Fire-Sketches-Before-Nature/dp/0874700299/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Heraclitean Fire</em></strong></a> is a book so magnificent as to make it almost criminal that commercial forces have swept it out of print. Perhaps a publisher who prioritizes cultural stewardship over such forces will take mercy on this forgotten treasure and bring it back to life. </p>

His editorial work for the journal impressed the publishers of the <em>The New York Times</em> imprint into offering him a book deal and so began his quest to capture &#8220;the fissures of race &#8230; as well as the fluid state of identity &#8212; the leaps through time, the collision of cultures &#8212; that mark our modern life.&#8221; </p>
<p>That young man was <strong>Barack Obama</strong> (b. August 4, 1961) and that manuscript became his lucid and lyrical memoir <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-My-Father-Story-Inheritance/dp/1400082773/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/dreams-from-my-father-a-story-of-race-and-inheritance/oclc/55534889&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>
<p>A beautiful writer with an unmistakable voice, Obama reflects on the extremes of ambition and self-doubt familiar to writers, all the more amplified by youth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like most first-time authors, I was filled with hope and despair upon the book’s publication &#8212; hope that the book might succeed beyond my youthful dreams, despair that I had failed to say anything worth saying. The reality fell somewhere in between.</p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until Obama had ascended in the political realm, more than a decade later, that his potent and poetic writing garnered the attention which its creative merit warrants. (I am reminded here of Hermann Hesse&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/07/the-magic-of-the-book-hermann-hesse-my-belief/">wonderfully prescient wisdom on publishing</a>: <em>&#8220;That stratum of writers and intellectuals which seems from time to time to lead because it shapes public opinion or at least supplies the slogans of the day &#8212; that stratum is not identical with the creative stratum.&#8221;</em>) But his mother, Stanley Ann &#8212; one of the most captivating presences in the book &#8212; didn&#8217;t live to savor her son&#8217;s success. She had died of cancer, &#8220;with a brutal swiftness,&#8221; a few months after the book&#8217;s publication.  </p>

<p>And yet it was she who had taught Obama about what would become the greatest guiding force of his life &#8212; the power of love, not only in the impersonally interpersonal political sense of building on Martin Luther King, Jr.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/01/martin-luther-king-jr-an-experiment-in-love/">&#8220;experiment in love,&#8221;</a> but in its most personal manifestation between two human beings who have chosen each other as partners in every dimension of life, the trying and the triumphant, and continue to choose each other every day of their lives. </p>
<p>In one of the most moving passages in the book, Obama tells the story of how his parents got together &#8212; an anecdote his mother once relayed, which illustrates the wonderfully imperfect yet unconditional nature of real love. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>She sighed, running her hands through her hair. “We were so young, you know. I was younger than you are now. He was only a few years older than that&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>She stopped and laughed to herself. “Did I ever tell you that he was late for our first date? He asked me to meet him in front of the university library at one. When I got there he hadn’t arrived, but I figured I’d give him a few minutes. It was a nice day, so I laid out on one of the benches, and before I knew it I had fallen asleep. Well, an hour later &#8212; an hour! &#8212; he shows up with a couple of his friends. I woke up and the three of them were standing over me, and I heard your father saying, serious as can be, ‘You see, gentlemen. I told you that she was a fine girl, and that she would wait for me.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>Embedded in the story is a broader meditation on time, the universality of the human experience, and what we each most long for as we surrender, often with enormous resistance and at the price of great discomfort, to love:</p>
<blockquote><p>My mother laughed once more, and once again I saw her as the child she had been. Except this time I saw something else: In her smiling, slightly puzzled face, I saw what all children must see at some point if they are to grow up &#8212; their parents’ lives revealed to them as separate and apart, reaching out beyond the point of their union or the birth of a child, lives unfurling back to grandparents, great-grandparents, an infinite number of chance meetings, misunderstandings, projected hopes, limited circumstances. My mother was that girl with the movie of beautiful black people in her head, flattered by my father’s attention, confused and alone, trying to break out of the grip of her own parents’ lives. The innocence she carried that day, waiting for my father, had been tinged with misconceptions, her own needs. But it was a guileless need, one without self-consciousness, and perhaps that’s how any love begins, impulses and cloudy images that allow us to break across our solitude, and then, if we’re lucky, are finally transformed into something firmer. What I heard from my mother that day, speaking about my father, was &#8230; the love of someone who knows your life in the round, a love that will survive disappointment. She saw my father as everyone hopes at least one other person might see him; she had tried to help the child who never knew him see him in the same way. And it was the look on her face that day that I would remember when a few months later I called to tell her that my father had died and heard her cry out over the distance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama began writing this memoir the summer he met the love of his own life, 25-year-old Michelle Robinson. The two were married three years later and he soon came to echo what his mother&#8217;s story had taught him about love in articulating his own experience of that supreme human gift. In 1996, when Obama was still unsure of whether he would pursue a political career or become a writer, photographer <a href="http://www.cookstudio.com/gallery/" target="_blank">Mariana Cook</a> &#8212; who would later come to photograph <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/06/27/mariana-cook-justice/">some of the world&#8217;s greatest human rights leaders</a> &#8212; visited Barack and Michelle Obama in their Chicago home as part of a project exploring coupledom in America. </p>

<p>Cook conducted a short <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/a-couple-in-chicago" target="_blank">interview</a> with the future President and First Lady, in which 35-year-old Obama reflects on the mystery and magnetism of his love for his wife:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michelle is a tremendously strong person, and has a very strong sense of herself and who she is and where she comes from. But I also think in her eyes you can see a trace of vulnerability that most people don’t know, because when she’s walking through the world she is this tall, beautiful, confident woman. There is a part of her that is vulnerable and young and sometimes frightened, and I think seeing both of those things is what attracted me to her.</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing Virginia Woolf&#8217;s abiding wisdom on <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/11/virginia-woolf-on-relationships-marriage/">the &#8220;moments of vision&#8221; that make relationships last</a>, he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>What sustains our relationship is I’m extremely happy with her, and part of it has to do with the fact that she is at once completely familiar to me, so that I can be myself and she knows me very well and I trust her completely, but at the same time she is also a complete mystery to me in some ways. And there are times when we are lying in bed and I look over and sort of have a start. Because I realize here is this other person who is separate and different and has different memories and backgrounds and thoughts and feelings. It’s that tension between familiarity and mystery that makes for something strong, because, even as you build a life of trust and comfort and mutual support, you retain some sense of surprise or wonder about the other person.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1944, Arendt met the writer and political activist <strong>Mary McCarthy</strong> (June 21, 1912&ndash;October 25, 1989) in a Manhattan bar. So began an intense lifelong friendship. After Arendt&#8217;s death, McCarthy became her literary executor. Their letters, collected in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Friends-Correspondence-McCarthy-1949-1975/dp/015100112X/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Between Friends: The Correspondence of Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/between-friends-the-correspondence-of-hannah-arendt-and-mary-mccarthy-1949-1975/oclc/29563806&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), are on par with such great epistolary friendships as those between <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/08/hermann-hesse-thomas-mann-appreciation-letters/">Thomas Mann and Hermann Hesse</a>, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/02/26/robert-lowell-bipolar/">Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell</a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/02/denise-levertov-letters-creativity/">Denise Levertov and Robert Duncan</a>.</p>

<p>What makes Arendt and McCarthy&#8217;s correspondence so remarkable is its uncommon combination of intellectual rigor and unflinching openheartedness. In between offering comprehensive feedback on each other&#8217;s work and discussing subjects ranging from consciousness to politics to Kant, they also share the most irrational perplexities of the human heart &#8212; nowhere more movingly than in the realm of romance.</p>
<p>A decade into her marriage to her third husband, Bowden Broadwater, 46-year-old McCarthy had grown restless in a relationship founded on affection and agreeableness rather than passion. In May of 1956, she met an English book reviewer and former heavyweight boxer named John Davenport, and the two embarked upon an ardent affair. But the following spring, through a chance encounter with a friend of Davenport&#8217;s named Mr. Hughes (whom Davenport had initially introduced as his cousin but who in actually was not), she discovered that her lover was a pathological liar, an alcoholic, and an occasional thief. </p>
<p>McCarthy was completely shocked by the revelations, and yet what her intellect found morally repugnant her heart refused to factor into the infatuation. She wrote to Arendt, reporting this unbearable psychoemotional dissonance: </p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is, I still care about him, just as much as ever, though perhaps this feeling would not last if I saw him in actuality. But this caring, of course, is really hopeless now. Hughes says <em>he</em> is hopeless and I believe him&#8230; Hughes says he started to write too late and lacks all discipline and habits of work, so that he keeps making these massive escapes into lies and drinking. Hughes says there&#8217;s a strong self-destructive urge in him and that, whatever the superficial motive, good or bad, that made him break off our correspondence, the real thing must have been that he was rejecting the one thing that could have saved him.</p>
<p>Oh, Hannah, isn&#8217;t it awful? I still would do anything for him &#8230; but what <em>can</em> I do?</p></blockquote>
<p>In a letter from early June, Arendt counsels McCarthy on these &#8220;crooked corkscrews of the heart&#8221; (a phrase of W.H. Auden&#8217;s, which Arendt loved) and the whole romantic delusion of being able to save anyone from themselves, to love them out of their demons &#8212; a delusion responsible, I would argue, for the vast majority of broken hearts the human race has produced. Arendt writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When an acknowledged liar speaks the truth, he does not want to be believed&#8230; There are two things which could &#8220;save&#8221; him: either a woman, but then saved for what? Evidently for some form of respectability. Or: more than talents, namely almost genius, or a talent so compelling that it will overrule everything else. (This is of course the case of people like Brecht or Heidegger.) But if this Who they are is not matched by qualities and gifts, what can there remain to do? And then life becomes a very long and rather boring business; for the Who as such is nowhere recognized in our society, there is no place for it. Under such circumstances, to destroy oneself and become &#8220;self-destructive&#8221; can be a time-consuming and rather honorable job. More honorable and probably less boring than to save oneself. The only thing which is really not permissible is to drag other people into one&#8217;s own amusements&#8230; Certainly, there is a great deal of cruelty in all this; but then you can&#8217;t expect somebody who loves you to treat you less cruelly than he would treat himself.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCarthy was eventually able to extricate herself from the relationship despite its self-mutilating magnetism. But by the spring of 1960, her marriage to Broadwater already beyond salvation, she was head-over-heels in love with another man &#8212; a diplomat named James West. In a letter to Arendt from that May, while separated from her husband and awaiting a final divorce as West was working on the same with his wife, McCarthy writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dearest Hannah:</p>
<p>The next mail leaves in forty-five minutes, and I&#8217;m writing you this note for purely selfish reasons: because my heart is full of emotion and I want to talk. As if we were in your apartment. Bowden &#8230; has written three times in response to my last letter, and so I&#8217;ve purposely slowed down a little on answering, not to keep up a fevered correspondence with him, which would awaken all sorts of hopes. Indeed, they <em>are</em> awake. And it&#8217;s so sad, because I grow fonder of him as he recedes a little into the distance and all the memories become good ones; the thought of him suffering, moreover, makes me want to scream aloud. He writes that he is not sorry, in a way, that this happened because it made him realize what he wanted or loved, and that he never knew he wanted or loved anything before.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and as a strange and soaring trumpet-music to this growing tenderness I feel for Bowden, my love for Jim is increasing till I am quite dizzy. I find myself changing or perhaps that is not the right word, coming to life in a new way, like somebody who has been partly paralyzed. And I&#8217;ve become conscious in myself of certain shrunken or withered character-traits that I never reckoned with before. Quite unpleasant they are too. You remember my telling you once that my marriage to Bowden was just two people playing house, like congenial children? Well, I slowly realize that all my love affairs and marriages have been little games like that &#8212; and snug, sheltered games. And that all this should happen with a U.S. government official seems utterly bizarre in a way&#8230; So I shall stop and run for the mail and only end by sending you much, much love and winged thoughts.</p>
<p>Mary</p></blockquote>

<p>Arendt had cautioned McCarthy against getting hurt in that familiar way of trying to change another person with the sheer power of her love. In a letter sent three days later, while suggesting that certain kinds of getting hurt are the inevitable growing pains of love, Arendt reiterates the admonition against that particular peril:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Some] getting hurt &#8230; is only another way of being alive. But, please don&#8217;t fool yourself: nobody ever was cured of anything, trait or habit, by a mere woman, though this is precisely what all girls think they can do. Either you are willing to take him &#8220;as is&#8221; or you better leave well enough alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>A week later, after sharing with West some of her romantic history and incurring a fit of his jealous fury, McCarthy reflects on the incident in her response to Arendt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hannah, I don&#8217;t know what you meant about my getting hurt, unless (as I thought) that he had the power to hurt me, that is to use me badly, as they say. Well, he has and he could. It surprised him&#8230; It surprised me too. Our joint surprise was perhaps rather funny &#8212; naive. But it &#8220;taught&#8221; him something and me something. We&#8217;ve both been mulling this over by mail ever since &#8212; rather mulling over the implications. The problem is how to curb this tendency (which is really, with him, a form of self-laceration) without closing off certain areas. I.e., my natural tendency would be not to tell him things that I expected would bother him and his would be not to show that he was bothered, not to let me see his suspicions or jealousy. But that way you would soon land in a relation of complete falsity &#8212; manipulating the truth and each other. And the point of this love is its honesty; everything is offered, nothing is held back. It&#8217;s total, like total war, and that power or drive comes from him. I have never known another man who had it and I&#8217;ve also become aware of how prudent (in spite of being romantic) I&#8217;ve always been myself, how many precautions I take against being wounded. So there is the dilemma. If we aren&#8217;t careful, he <em>will</em> hurt me, for I&#8217;m particularly alive to a sense of injustice, of being wrongly suspected or accused, and if he hurts me I will start protecting myself by congealing [<em>sic</em>]. And yet we don&#8217;t want to be &#8220;careful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Echoing the assertion that Martin Heidegger, Arendt&#8217;s great love, had made in <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/25/hannah-arendt-martin-heidegger-love-letters/">their beautiful love letters</a> decades earlier &#8212; what makes love so transformative, he asserted, is that &#8220;we become what we love and yet remain ourselves&#8221; &#8212; McCarthy adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite your warning that nobody ever changes for a mere woman, I think we shall both change a little. What&#8217;s the use of falling in love if you both remain inertly as-you-were? If he hopes for an inner change, a release from the monotony of certain habitual reactions, that&#8217;s partly why he&#8217;s in love, why he troubled, so to speak, to fall in love instead of just having an affair. And the hope is part of the man as much as the habitual reactions. If you take him &#8220;as is&#8221; you take the hope too.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Valentine&#8217;s Day in 1961, McCarthy and Broadwater finally obtained their divorce. She married West almost immediately and the two remained together for twenty-eight years, until death did them part. </p>

<p>Perhaps because trees are <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/04/14/the-oldest-living-things-in-the-world-rachel-sussman-book/">the oldest living things in the world</a>, they have permeated <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/09/20/the-night-life-of-trees-tara-books/">our ancient mythology</a> and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/07/17/the-book-of-trees-manuel-lima/">our scientific sensemaking</a>.

<blockquote><p>Don’t worry about getting bonked on the bean with a pod: cocoa trees don’t lose their seed pods, even when ripe. They dry up, unless, of course, a hungry parrot happens by.</p>
<p>I hope you didn’t forget your adventurer’s cooking kit: a club, a banana tree leaf, an oven, some rocks, and a healthy dose of patience.</p>
<p>Smash three pods with your club and save one hundred seeds to make about four ounces of chocolate. Let them ferment for a week, and a white pulp will seep out. Next, let them dry on a banana tree leaf for two weeks, stirring them frequently: you’ll get brown cocoa “beans.” Now break open their shells, wash them, and roast them for twenty to thirty minutes at 215 to 285 degrees Fahrenheit. Then crush them over heat with rocks. Now you have “cocoa paste,” from which you can make chocolate.</p></blockquote>

When he was twenty-two, while dating another young man, Cage met artist Xenia Kashevaroff &#8212; the Alaskan-born daughter of a Russian priest. He fell instantly in love &#8212; perhaps with Xenia herself, perhaps with the promise of life that conformed to social convention and appeased his inner conflictedness about his orientation, perhaps with some combination of the two. They were married in the spring of 1935. But as Cage continued to discover his voice creatively, he had no choice but to make room for his whole self. By the early 1940s, the couple had begun to grow apart and their marriage soon ended in divorce.</p>

<p>It was around the same time that Cage met the dance prodigy <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/10/03/merce-cunningham-the-creative-experience/">Merce Cunningham</a>, who would go on to become one of the most innovative and influential choreographers of all time. Then in his early twenties, Cunningham was one of several choreographers with whom Cage had begun working in his quest to explore the physical dimension of sound. Although their relationship began as a creative collaboration, a vitalizing romantic electricity developed between them as they got to know each other. Cunningham became Cage&#8217;s great love and remained his spouse for the remainder of the composer&#8217;s life. </p>
<p>The correspondence from the dawn of their uncommon and intensely beautiful romance, found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Letters-John-Cage/dp/0819575917/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Selected Letters of John Cage</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/selected-letters-of-john-cage/oclc/907190295&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), is on par with <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/12/03/letters-to-vera-vladimir-nabokov/">Nabokov&#8217;s love letters</a> &#8212; that gold standard of this most intimate genre of the written word &#8212; and makes a crowning addition to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/02/14/greatest-queer-love-letters/">history&#8217;s greatest LGBT love letters</a>.</p>

<p>In their first surviving romantic correspondence, postmarked June 28, 1943, Cage writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Merce,</p>
<p>Saturday night nearly went crazy, because, not solving my problems until they occur, I ever suddenly realized you were gone. Fly away with you but was in a zoo.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when it was that I found out how to let this month go by without continual sentimental pain. It&#8217;s very simple now, because I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing you again rather than backward to having seen you recently. That&#8217;s a happy way to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sublime testament to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/05/adam-phillips-missing-out-frustration-love/">the interplay of frustration and satisfaction in love</a>, Cage adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m unsentimental but I&#8217;m sitting at one of our tables and looking in a mirror where you often were.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know: this gravity elastic feeling to let go and fall together with you is one thing, but it is better to live exactly where you are with as many permanent emotions in you as you can muster. Talking to myself.</p>
<p>Your spirit is with me.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following day, Cage writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rain finally came + it&#8217;s beautifully cool. Wonder how long it will last. It was marvelous because it started suddenly and then was alternately terrific and gentle. </p>
<p>I think of you all the time and therefor have little to say that would not embarrass you, for instance my first feeling about the rain was that it was like you.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Love you.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this letter, Cage encloses a poem he has written for his new love:</p>
<blockquote><p>POEM. CAUSE: I LOVE YOU.</p>
<p>As leaf with tree, I long to be<br />
With you. A twig connection<br />
If no other, would satisfy.</p>
<p>Sap from your trunk to vivify<br />
My tissues; my one election:<br />
On food you give to have satiety.</p>
<p>Will leaf turn dry and dead? My<br />
Deep need to pale affection<br />
Fade? Will snail transform to tree?</p>
<p>If leaf dies, Spring will mystify<br />
The Winter. No death for tree:<br />
Leaf adorned, &#8217;twill live in ev&#8217;ry<br />
section.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three days later, on July 2, Cage writes from the pit of longing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I get terribly lonesome for you.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I nearly left this earth a few minutes ago &#8212; ecstasy &#8212; word from you. Pretty soon I&#8217;ll write music for you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later that month, while Cunningham was in residence with the Martha Graham Dance Company at Bennington College in Vermont, Cage beseeches from New York with affectionate impatience:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please be lonesome enough to come back in not too distant time.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>I love you and often think of fancy reasons why: spirit is very close to me and mine, I sent it, close to you.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>My whole desire is to run up and down the sea coast looking for you.</p>
<p>Love</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Selected-Letters-John-Cage/dp/0819575917/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-54945"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?resize=680%2C151&#038;ssl=1" alt="cage_kiss" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-54945" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?resize=240%2C53&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?resize=320%2C71&amp;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?resize=768%2C170&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?resize=600%2C133&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cage_kiss.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Over the year that followed, their love only intensified. In a particularly poetic and picturesque letter from July of 1944, Cage writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>your letters i just plain love: they bring you so close that at any moment i expect the door will open and you will see me camouflaged in enigmatic home, built on shoes you made.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Country was beautiful, and lying on the grass so that i could sometimes see the net a tree is against the sky or turning make a space for eyes between two trees and watch bird-movements across and in it. Beautiful daisies and a jungle of tiger lilies. Multitudinous lakes and canoes. I could tell how distinctly happy you would be in country wherever; and i really need not be with you for me or for you, because there was facility in inventing your presence and knowing that just then you were merely not visible or not audible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nine days later, Cage writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>your last letter is so beautiful i cannot answer it, only read it and lie on it.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>i am often in deep pain; i am afraid i am not human being<br />
i talk to you all day long but when i start to write i cannot</p></blockquote>
<p>Later that month, many decades after Van Gogh articulated <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/04/20/van-gogh-heartbreak/">how love catalyzes creative work</a>, Cage speaks to this all-consuming muse:</p>
<blockquote><p>today is beautiful and i am dreaming of you and enigma and how we are together today: your words in my ears making [me] limp and taut by turns with delight. oh, i am sure we could use each other today.</p>
<p>i like to believe that you are writing my music now: god knows i&#8217;m not doing it, because it simply seems to happen. the pretissimo is incredible the way you are and is perhaps a description and song about you.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>pardon the intrusion: but when in september will you be back? i would like to measure my breath in relation to the air between us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cage and Cunningham continued to fill the air between them with love until the composer&#8217;s final breath.</p>

Without it we lose our identity,&#8221;</em> legendary cosmologist Stephen Hawking <a href="http://explore.brainpickings.org/post/145565632378/if-the-rules-break-down-in-black-holes-they-may" target="_blank">declared</a> in discussing his groundbreaking theory that the rules of physics might break down inside black holes, which would challenge our most fundamental assumptions about space, time, and reality itself. If the past, present, and future no longer inform one another in their standard linearity, then even our memory might be an illusion, the theory suggests. </p>
<p>But here on Earth, where the laws of physics apply unperturbed and govern our lives, memory is the most elemental thread of which the tapestry of experience we call reality is woven. Nothing illustrates this more powerfully than the fraying and rupturing of that thread, and no one has demonstrated this profound cosmogony of personhood more profoundly than Henry Gustav Molaison (February 26, 1926&ndash;December 2, 2008), better known as <strong>H.M.</strong> &#8212; perhaps the most famous patient in the history of medicine. </p>
<p>At the age of twenty-seven, in an effort to cure his debilitating epilepsy, H.M. underwent a surgery that removed portions of his brain where the seizures were thought to take place. The seizures stopped, but H.M. developed severe anterograde amnesia &#8212; an inability to form new memories. His unusual condition and his willingness to participate in research made him the perfect subject for the study of memory. Over the course of his long life, Henry generously donated his time and, after his death, even his brain to the advancement of science. </p>

<p>The research conducted on H.M. since 1957, which has furnished much of what we know about how memory works, has inspired innumerable papers and books. But none is more significant nor more moving than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Permanent-Present-Tense-Memory-Taught/dp/0141044314/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Permanent Present Tense: The Unforgettable Life of the Amnesic Patient, H.M.</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/permanent-present-tense-the-unforgettable-life-of-the-amnesic-patient-hm/oclc/778420638&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) by MIT neuroscientist <strong>Suzanne Corkin</strong> (May 18, 1937&ndash;May 24, 2016) &#8212; the pioneering memory researcher who worked with Henry for nearly half a century, gleaned from his case pioneering insight into how memory works, and was, in some sense, his most constant companion and unflinching friend. </p>
<p>The book is as much a fascinating chronicle of how our understanding of memory has evolved over the past century as it is an affectionate tribute to Henry and his patient generosity of spirit in lending his innermost self to the furtherance of scientific knowledge. Permeating Corkin&#8217;s rigorous research is a profound empathy and unsentimental sensitivity to the human being behind the patient. </p>

<p>She contextualizes the reality-warping world H.M. inhabited:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amnesic patients such as Henry are stripped of their ability to turn their immediately present experiences into lasting memories.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Henry was a young man of twenty-seven when he had the operation. Now sixty-six, he relied on a walker to prevent falls. But to him, only a short time had passed. In the decades after his operation, he lived in a permanent present tense: he could no longer remember the faces of people he met, places he visited, or moments he lived through. His experiences slipped out of his consciousness seconds after they happened.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Memory is an essential component of everything we do, but we are not consciously aware of its scope and importance. We take memory for granted. As we walk, talk, and eat, we are not aware that our behavior stems from information and skills that we previously learned and remembered. We rely constantly on our memory to get us through each moment and each day. We need memory to survive &#8212; without it, we would not know how to clothe ourselves, navigate our neighborhoods, or communicate with others. Memory enables us to revisit our experiences, to learn from the past, and even to plan what to do in the future. It provides continuity from moment to moment, morning to evening, day to day, and year to year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corkin first met Henry in 1962, five years after his surgery and the onset of his amnesia, but the peripheries of their lives had intersected in a strange Venn diagram decades earlier. She recounts the serendipity that only amplifies the deeply humane curiosity animating her scientific relationship with Henry:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was seven, I became close friends with a girl who lived across the street from my family. I remember her father zooming up our street in his fire-engine-red Jaguar, and on weekends, dressed in mechanic’s overalls, tinkering with the car’s machinery underneath. </p>
<p>My friend’s father was a neurosurgeon. As a child, I had no idea what a neurosurgeon did. Years later, when I was a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at McGill University, this man reentered my life. While reading articles on memory in medical journals, I came across a report by a doctor who had performed a brain operation to cure a young man’s intractable epilepsy. The operation caused the patient to lose his capacity to establish new memories. The doctor who coauthored the article was my friend’s father, William Beecher Scoville. The patient was Henry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many years later, Corkin found herself doing her Ph.D. work at the famed Montreal neuroscience laboratory run by Brenda Milner &#8212; the first psychologist to test H.M. after his surgery and the co-author of a germinal 1957 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC497229/" target="_blank">paper</a> about his case, which revolutionized the science of memory and became one of the most cited papers of all time. In 1962, while at Milner&#8217;s lab, Corkin got a chance to test H.M.&#8217;s memory for her thesis. </p>
<p>So began one of the longest and most fruitful patient-researcher relationships in the history of science. </p>
<p>Although Corkin&#8217;s initial investigation lasted only a week, H.M.&#8217;s extraordinary case and its unprecedented value to the science of memory continued to haunt her. So, after migrating to MIT, she decided to pursue him as a research subject, to which he generously consented. Corkin went on to study H.M. for the remaining forty-six years of his life and dedicated her own to making light of these findings, which illuminate everything from the psychology of identity to the perplexities of aging.</p>

<p>Corkin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our identity is composed of narratives we construct based on our personal history. What happens if we can no longer hold our experiences in our brain long enough to string them together? The link between memory and identity lies at the heart of our apprehensions about aging and cognitive decline. Losing our memory to dementia seems an unimaginable misfortune, yet this is what all of adult life was like for Henry. As his present moved forward, it left no trail of memory behind it, like a hiker who leaves no footprints.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Memory is not a single event, not a snapshot fixed in celluloid with the click of a shutter. We have learned &#8212; initially from Henry &#8212; that memory does not reside in one spot in the brain. Instead, memory engages many parts of the brain in parallel. We can think of remembering as a trip to the supermarket to buy all the ingredients for beef stew. We select the meat, vegetables, stock, and spices from different parts of the store and then combine them in a large stew pot at home. Similarly, calling up the memory of one’s last birthday entails pulling information stored in different parts of the brain &#8212; the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes—and organizing these stored traces in a way that allows us to relive the experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>A crucial point to remember is that if neuroscience today is in its infancy &#8212; as Maria Konnikova <a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker/status/739251536367386624" target="_blank">has noted</a>, it is where astronomy was in Galileo&#8217;s time &#8212; neuroscience in the 1960s barely existed at all. In fact, the word itself was coined in 1962 &#8212; the very year Corkin began working with H.M. At the time, scientists knew very little about the brain and its inner workings, and even less about memory &#8212; about what processes it entails, where in the brain they take place, and how they affect the cohesion of our selfhood. </p>
<p>With this in mind, it&#8217;s important to appreciate that Corkin&#8217;s pioneering contribution is not only to what memory is but also to what it isn&#8217;t in the great puzzle of our personhood. In a passage emblematic of the warm humanity undergirding her research, she writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>One basic yet crucial lesson that Henry taught us was that it is possible to lose the ability to remember, yet remain intelligent, articulate, and perceptive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over and over, Corkin makes special note of Henry&#8217;s altruism. In addition to allowing her and more than a hundred other scientists to study him for the better half of his life, he continued to make significant contributions even after his death, donating his brain to research. By slicing it and studying its structure, scientists could begin to map physical dimension onto the the half-century of robust psychological and behavioral data. This link between structure and function, Corkin points out, is invaluable to science and to our understanding of how the brain works, which in turn paves the way for developing new methods for repairing what doesn&#8217;t work in order to improve and save lives.

<p>Corkin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Henry&#8217;s] story is not just a medical curiosity; it is a testament to the impact that a single subject can have. Henry’s case answered more questions about memory than the entire previous century of scientific research. Although he lived his own life in the present tense, Henry had a permanent impact on the science of memory, and on the thousands of patients who have benefited from his contributions.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Henry’s case was revolutionary because it told the world that memory formation could be contained in a specific part of the brain. Before his operation, physicians and scientists acknowledged that the brain was the seat of conscious memory, but had no conclusive proof that declarative memory was localized to a circumscribed area. Henry provided us with <em>causal proof</em> that a discrete brain region deep in the temporal lobes is absolutely critical for converting short-term memories into enduring ones.</p></blockquote>
<figure  class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/04/02/neurocomic-nobrow/"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/neurocomic4.jpg" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Art from <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/04/02/neurocomic-nobrow/"><em>Neurocomic</em></a>, a graphic novel about how the brain works</figcaption></figure>
<p>She zooms out into the bigger picture of why this work is so important in the first place:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ultimate goal of neuroscience is to understand how the billions of neurons in the brain, each with roughly 10,000 synapses, interact to create the workings of the mind. </p>
<p>We will, of course, never fully achieve that goal. Even as I type these words, I wonder what exactly is going on in my overcrowded brain. How do my networks of neurons marshal together the pieces of complex technical information I have learned, synthesize them into thoughts and perspectives, and put the total sum into words my fingers are then directed to type? How remarkable that the brain can fashion simple sentences out of such chaos. We will never have a formula to fully explain how the noisy activity of our brains gives rise to thoughts, emotions, and behavior. But the magnitude of the goal makes pursuing it all the more exciting. This challenge attracts brilliant adventurers and risk takers to our field. And even if we will never completely understand the way the brain works, whatever small part of the truth we are able to learn will bring us one step closer to understanding who we are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corkin died six days after her seventy-ninth birthday, having devoted the majority of her life to gleaning insight into the machinery of memory from Henry&#8217;s case. Like her patient and friend, she donated her brain to science. </p>

It cannot be better than they are.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The end of the 1960s was an era of enormous social change, both hope-giving and vulnerable-making, when a new scientific revolution was <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/06/02/primo-levi-mirror-maker-science-space/">bringing humanity closer together</a> and the civil rights movement was finding new ways to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/07/01/martin-luther-king-jr-an-experiment-in-love/">keep us from being kept apart</a>. Amid such massive and disorienting change, what people need most is a sense of agency, best acquired by instilling a passion for civic engagement and cultivating a sense of participatory responsibility from an early age.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s what writer <strong>Muriel Stanek</strong> and illustrator <strong>Jack Faulkner</strong> set out to do in the rare 1969 gem <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-our-government-helps-us/dp/B007EJG90U/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>How Our Government Helps Us</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/how-our-government-helps-us/oclc/781&#038;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) &#8212; a delightful primary school supplement, part of the same Social Studies Program series that produced <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/11/how-people-earn-and-use-money-1968/"><em>How People Use and Earn Money</em></a>, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/27/how-people-live-in-the-suburbs/"><em>How People Live in the Suburbs</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/04/how-we-use-maps-and-globes-1968/"><em>How We Use Maps and Globes</em></a>.</p>

<p>In vibrant drawings and simple language, the book explains the different layers of government &#8212; city, county, state, and federal &#8212; and their respective functions. What is edifying to the child is to the grownup reader a wonderful reminder of the many things we take for granted in the seemingly magical functioning of our daily lives, from the trash collection in our cities to public transportation to the parks and playgrounds in our neighborhoods. </p>

<p>Written mere months before the moon landing, the story honors the dawn of this new era of space exploration and scientific discovery. </p>

<p>The book is both ahead and very much of its time. The illustrations feature a woman doctor and quite a few people of color, including a police officer and a Supreme Court judge, but almost every instance of government power &#8212; cabinet members, senators, governors, the president himself &#8212; depicts middle-aged white men. Indeed, what makes the book particularly noteworthy is that it captures the perennial problem of social change &#8212; however far we may have come in our earnest effort toward equality, there is still that much further to go, and centuries of cultural conditioning often blind us to the proper direction of the new path. </p>
