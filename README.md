Pretty Parser
=============

**A personalized RSS reader.**\\

You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system along with the Beautiful Soup library.\\
*Run the file. 
*Call the `fetch()` function to download all the XML files.
*Call the `pparser()` function to read your feed in your system's default browser.\\

Of course you can edit the `feeds` dictionary and the corresponding `feed_tags` list to whichever feeds you want to follow.\\

*Note to self: Someday I will turn it into a browser add-on.*
